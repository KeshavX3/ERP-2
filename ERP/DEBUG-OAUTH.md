## Debugging Google OAuth Issue

### Problem:
- Email verification is being sent ✅
- But verification page is not opening ❌
- Register page is opening instead ❌

### Quick Fix Steps:

1. **Start Backend Server:**
   ```bash
   cd "e:\New folder\ERP"
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start Frontend Client:**
   ```bash
   cd "e:\New folder\ERP"
   npm run client
   ```

3. **Test Google OAuth:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Open Browser Console (F12)
   - Click "Continue with Google"
   - Watch for console logs starting with 🔍 and ✅

### Expected Complete Flow:
```
🔍 AuthModal: handleGoogleSuccess called with: {credential: "..."}
🔍 AuthContext: Calling backend with credential
🔍 AuthContext: Raw response from backend: {success: true, requiresVerification: true, userId: "...", email: "..."}
✅ AuthContext: User needs verification, returning verification data
✅ AuthModal: Verification required, navigating to verify-email
🚀 AuthModal: Using window.location to navigate
📋 VerifyEmail: Loaded data from sessionStorage: {userId: "...", email: "...", fromGoogleAuth: true}
✅ VerifyEmail: Valid verification data found
[User enters OTP and clicks verify]
✅ VerifyEmail: Verification successful, storing token
✅ VerifyEmail: Token stored, redirecting to products
[Page redirects to /products with user logged in]
```

### After Verification Fix:
- **Token is stored** in localStorage ✅
- **Page redirects** to /products using window.location.href ✅  
- **AuthContext initializes** and reads the token ✅
- **User is authenticated** and can shop ✅

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Switched to `window.location.href`** instead of React Router navigate
2. **Added sessionStorage backup** for verification data
3. **Enhanced VerifyEmail page** to read from multiple sources
4. **Added data cleanup** after successful verification

### If You See Different Output:
1. Check if backend response has `requiresVerification: true`
2. Look for any error messages in console
3. Check if navigation is being blocked

### Manual Test:
If Google OAuth still fails, try manually navigating to:
http://localhost:3000/verify-email

This will help isolate if the issue is with navigation or with the OAuth flow.
